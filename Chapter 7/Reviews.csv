For example the receiver element of the hive can be slotted onto the base plates for many existing boiler controllers which means that no rewiring was required.  Also the hive thermostat is battery powered and needs no wires or external supply.  Merely pick a location and fit the back plate with the enclosed screws to the wall.  The back plate of the thermostat is even designed with holes arranged so that it can be fitted to a standard single gang back box.  The thermostat is simple and intuitive to use as well as being aesthetically pleasing.  The temperature setting dial and buttons give positive, tactile feedback and are precise and solid.  The user interface online and on the mobile is simple and concise and its easy to control the device and set schedules.  I have a combi boiler in the attic with a controller where i could set a schedule and control the boiler in a cupboard up stairs, but didn't have any room thermostats  So my main reason for installing the hive was to provide temperature control of my central heating system rather than relying on the position of the valves on the individual radiators.  Installation was extremely simple,  as mentioned I simply removed the front of the old controller and fitted the new transmitter to the base, plugged the wireless unit into my router and mounted the thermostat on the wall in my living room.

The Hive 2 ticked all the right boxes - the thermostat looks good and is properly wireless (powered by 4 AA batteries) meaning I have the option to put it _anywhere_ in my house, even where there isn't a power socket nearby; the same cannot be said of Nest which was initially on my wish list. While the Nest can work wirelessly, it's for a few hours at most and needs to be positioned near to a socket. Imagining the location of most people's thermostats, I don't think they would want an extension cable and a USB adapter dangling off the wall - that isn't pretty anywhere."", ""The installation was not without its troubles - I was replacing an existing wireless thermostat wired in to different terminals than a 240v thermostat in my boiler so I don't mind admitting I asked someone for guidance. If I'm honest (and to make myself feel better), the main reason I had to ask for assistance was because the boiler's wiring diagram wasn't crystal clear. Asking for assistance can be a mine field. My boiler front cover is lined with foam and held on by a single 10mm bolt and two steel clips at the bottom (Vaillant 2013 model) - it is not a complex undertaking to remove it and replace it properly but some gas safe engineers insist on telling you only they are capable of removing and replacing something like this safely. Legally they're correct but replacing a 10mm bolt and two steel clips does not require a degree in mechanical engineering - just know what you're doing and if in doubt, speak to a pro. That said, if you are capable but don't have an existing 240v thermostat or the ability to interpret a wiring diagram, get a pro to do it."", ""When you first put batteries in the Thermostat you'll be asked whether you prefer comfort or energy saving, this determines the initial temperatures and schedule but these can be changed easily on the Hive website so don't agonise over the question too much. Once all the hardware is installed, you need to use the little booklet with a scratch off section at the back to get a code to use on the Hive website. This code is entered in to the Hive website at the URL provided in the bookley and then, once registered with your email address, you're on and customising. Get the app for your phone from your respective app store and use the username and password you created when registering on the Hive website to log in to that."", ""Shameless plug - if you're a Windows user and know what PowerShell is, I've abstracted the Hive API to allow control of the Hive (and therefore your heating system) using scripting (which you can schedule on a Windows computer of course).

I'm pleased I did. Obviously the most important part is to switch off the power first. I checked the wiring with a mains sensitive screwdriver first to be doubly sure. It took me less than 2 hours, working exceptionally slowly and carefully and checking and double checking at each stage. The only part which really wasn't covered in the instructions was what to do with the wiring behind my existing thermostat. I'd already checked what to do there and it was simply a matter of joining the two wires together using a proper connector.

There are three components, one next to the boiler, one near the router and a thermostat you can either wall mount or have free standing so you can move to different rooms.

You can also have more than one user on the app.', 'As it’s not too cold at the moment and I’m home most of the day,  I have mine on manual but you can set regular schedules (see photos). If I wake in the night and I’m cold I can easily put the heating on or turn it off if I’m too hot, also if you’re out and about you can control the heating, plus if you have them you can also do the same with your lights and sockets.
